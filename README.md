# Website Traffic Forecasting Using SARIMA

## Overview

This project focuses on forecasting website traffic using SARIMA (Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average), a statistical model designed to capture both trend and seasonality in time series data. The dataset contains daily traffic data for a year, offering insights into traffic patterns and allowing for predictive modeling.

By leveraging SARIMA, the project provides reliable forecasts that can be used for website planning, marketing strategies, and resource allocation.

## Key Features

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

- Identified trends, seasonality, and anomalies in daily traffic.
- Visualized patterns using time series decomposition and autocorrelation plots.

**Modeling with SARIMA:**

- Captured weekly seasonality and long-term trends in traffic.
- Used parameter tuning and diagnostics to optimize the model's performance.

**Forecasting:**

- Forecasted website traffic for the next 30 days, aligned with seasonal and trend components.

## Dataset

**Source**: Daily website traffic data from June 2021 to June 2022.
**Features**:

- `Date`: Daily timestamps.
- `Views`: Total website traffic per day.

# Steps in the Analysis

1. Data Preprocessing:

- Converted `Date` column to datetime format.
- Checked for missing values and outliers.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:

- Decomposed the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
- Visualized autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation to understand dependencies.

3. Model Building:

- Trained a SARIMA model with the best parameters:

  - Order (p, d, q): (5, 1, 2)
  - Seasonal Order (P, D, Q, s): (2, 1, 1, 7)

- Used grid search to optimize parameters.

4. Diagnostics:

- Assessed residuals to ensure the model captured all patterns.
- Evaluated the model's performance using AIC, BIC, and diagnostic plots.

5. Forecasting:

- Forecasted traffic for the next 30 days.
- Visualized predictions alongside observed data.

## Results

- Seasonality and Trends:

  - The model effectively captured weekly seasonality and a long-term upward trend in traffic.

- Residual Analysis:

  - Residuals resembled white noise, indicating a good fit.
  - A few residual outliers highlighted potential external factors (e.g., holidays).

- Forecast:

- The forecast aligned with historical patterns, demonstrating reliable performance for short-term predictions.

## Key Visualizations

- Seasonal Decomposition:

  - Visualized the trend, seasonality, and residuals in website traffic.

- Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation:

  - Confirmed weekly seasonality and short-term dependencies.

- Forecast Plot:

      * Displayed predicted traffic alongside observed values.

  ## Future Improvements

  1. Incorporate External Variables:

  - Include holidays, marketing events, or promotions as explanatory variables to improve accuracy.

  2. Address Residual Outliers:

  - Investigate causes of outliers and adjust the model accordingly.

  3. Experiment with Advanced Models:

  - Explore machine learning approaches (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) for comparison.

  ## Technologies Used

  - **Python**: Primary language for analysis and modeling.

  - Libraries:

    - `pandas`, `numpy`: Data manipulation and analysis.
    - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: Visualization.
    - `statsmodels`: SARIMA modeling and diagnostics.
